2.11.0:
	[ Eugène Filin ]
	* Fix incorrect variable initialization

	[ Eugene Kliuchnikov ]
	* CI/CD, build, etc

	   - setup GitHub workflows; test build under MSVC, OSX, MSYS2, Linux
	   - add CMake build system
	   - additionally add Bazel build
	   - remove automake and MSVC project files
	   - add fuzzers that cover almost all decoder code
	   - setup fuzzing for various builds: (no-)FIXED_POINT / (no-)DRM
	   - remove dead code
	   - address differes compilers warnings
	   - move version to distingished place that different build systems can read

	* "Safe" bugs

	   "Safe" means that it is unlikely to be exploited; those affect the decoded
	   result for (most likely) extreme inputs. Some fixes are useful only for
	   "FIXED_POINT" build, since it has more restrictions on intermediate values.

	   - "negative range" in estimate_current_envelope
	   - integer overflow in channel downmixing
	   - integer overflow in estimate_envelope
	   - integer overflows caused by "practical infinite" gain
	   - integer overflows in HF adjustment code
	   - several "left shift of negative value"
	   - priming RNG to avoid using values that does not look random at all
	   - do not drop the first frame of output; other decoders don't do this
	   - touching uninitialized values in lt_update_state
	   - touching uninitialized values in bit-reader buffers

	* "Almost Safe" bugs

	   "Almost safe" means that those are unlinkly to be exploited; if those surface
	   depends on build options / environment.

	   - division by zero in HF (noise?) generator and scale factor adjustment
	   - division by zero gen_rand_vector

	* "Unsafe" bugs

	   "Unsafe" means that those can cause crash, or could somehow else be exploited.

	   - CLI: accessing unallocated memory in mp4info (corrupted / zero-samples input) (CVE-2023-38857)
	   - CLI: out-of-bounds when parsing mp4 header
	   - CLI: crash because of wrong mp4 frame offset calculation (CVE-2023-38857)
	   - error handling rvlc_decode_scale_factors (CPU bomb?)
	   - null pointer dereference (in DRM + PS build)
	   - index-out-of-bounds / stack-buffer-overflow in decode_sce_lfe
		 (for streams with PCE)
	   - stack-buffer-overflow in pns_decode
	   - null pointer derefernce (when channels change their type in the middle
		 of the stream)
	   - infinite loop on currupted stream
	   - add practial limits for scale factors; otherwise calculated NaN/Inf values
		 could confuse further logic, resulting in access-out-of-bounds
	   - check sf_index in window_grouping_info to avoid access-out-of-bounds
	   - clamp bs_pointer values to avoid access-out-of-bounds
	   - infinite loop in fill_element
	   - sanitize input values in ps_mix_phase to avoid access-out-of-bounds
	   - fix internal decoder buffer size calculation to avoid heap-out-of-bounds
	   - calculate channel length multiplier even if main channel is already allocated
		 to avoid heap-out-of-bounds
	   - reserve enough slots for channels in decode_sce_lfe
		 to avoid heap-out-of-bounds
