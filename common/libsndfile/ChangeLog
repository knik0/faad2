    Use OS_SPOECIFIC_INCLUDES and OS_SPECIFIC_LINKS to build commands for
    sndfile-play.

2002-06-19  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/nist.c

    Removed exit command to allow cross-compiling.

    * Win32/unistd.h src/file_io.c
    Moved contents of first file into the second file (enclosed in #ifdef).
    Win32/unistd.h is now an empty file but still must be there for libsndfile 
    to compile on Win32.

    * src/sd2.c, src/sndfile.c:
    Fixes for Sound Designer II files on big endian systems.

2002-06-16  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * configure.in
    Modified to work around problems with crappy MacOSX version of sed.
    Added sanity check for proper values for CFLAGS.

2002-06-14  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/sndfile.c
    Code clean up in sf_open ().

    * Win32/Makefile.msvc
    Michael Fink's contributed MSVC++ makefile was hacked to bits and put back
    together in a new improved form.

    * src/file_io.c
    Fixes for Win32; _lseeki64() returns an invalid argument for calls like
    _lseeki64(fd, 0, SEEK_CUR) so need to use _telli64 (fd) instead.

    * src/common.h src/sndfile.c src/wav.c src/aiff.c
    Added SFE_LOG_OVERRUN error.
    Added termination for potential infinite loop when parsing file headers.

    * src/wav.c src/w64.c
    Fixed bug casuing incorrect header generation when opening file read/write.

2002-06-12  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * doc/api.html
    Improved the documentation to make it clearer that the file read method
    and the underlying file format are completely disconnected. Suggested
    by Josh Green.

    * doc/command.html
    Started correcting docs to take into account changes made to the
    operations of the sf_command () function. Not complete yet.

    * src/sndfile.c
    Reverted some changes which had broken the partially working SDII header
    parsing. Now have access to an iBook with OS X so reading and writing SDII
    files on all platforms should be a reality in the near future. On Mac this
    will involve reading the resource fork via the standard MacOS API. To move
    a file from Mac to another OS, the resource and data forks will need to be
    combined before transfer. The combined file will be read on both Mac and
    other OSes like any other file.

2002-06-08  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * ltmain.sh
    Applied a patch from http://fink.sourceforge.net/doc/porting/libtool.php
    which allows libsndfile to compile on MacOSX 10.1. This patch should not
    interfere with compiling on other OSes.

    * src/GSM610/private.h
    Changes to fix compile problems on MacOSX (see src/GSM610/ChangeLog).

    * src/float_cast.h
    Added MacOSX replacements for lrint() and lrintf().

2002-06-05  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/sndfile.c
    Replaced the code to print the filename to the log buffer when a file is
    opened. This code seems to have been left out during the merge of
    sf_open_read() and sf_open_write() to make a single  functions sf_open().

2002-06-01  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/wav.c
    Fixed a bug where the WAV header parser was going into an infinite loop
    on a badly formed LIST chunk. File supplied by David Viens.

2002-05-25  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * configure.in
    Added a message at the end of the configuration process to warn about the
    need for the use of pkg-config when linking programs against version 1 of
    libsndfile.

    * doc/pkg-config.html
    New documentation file containing details of how to use pkg-config to
    retrieve settings for CFLAGS and library locations for linking files
    against version 1 of libsndfile.

2002-05-17  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/wav.c
    Fixed minor bug in handling of so-called ACIDized WAV files.

2002-05-16  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * Win32/libsndfile.def Win32/Makefile.msvc
    Two new files contributed by Michael Fink (from the winLAME project)
    which allows libsndfile to be built on windows in a MSDOS box by doing
    "nmake -f Makefile.msvc". Way cool!

2002-05-15  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * configure.in
    MacOSX is SSSOOOOOOO screwed up!!! I can't believe how hard it is to
    generate a tarball which will configure and compile on that platform.
    Joined the libtool mailing list to try and get some answers.

2002-05-13  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * configure.in
    Changed to autoconf version 2.50. MacOSX uses autoconf version 2.53 which
    is incompatible with with version 2.13 which had been using until now.
    The AC_SYS_LARGE_FILE macro distributed withe autoconf 2.50 is missing a
    few features so AC_SYS_EXTRA_LARGE file was defined to replace it.

    * configure.in
    Changed to automake version 1.5 to try and make a tarball which will
    work on MacOSX.

2002-05-12  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/wav_gsm610.c
    Changed name to gsm610.c. Added reading/writing of headerless files.

    * src/sndfile.c src/raw.c
    Added ability to read/write headerless (SF_FORMAT_RAW) GSM 6.10 files.

2002-05-11  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * tests/lossy_comp_test.c
    Clean up in preparation for Autogen-ing this file.

    * src/GSM610/*.[ch]
    Code cleanup and prepartion forgetting file seek working. Details in
    src/GSM610/ChangeLog.

    * sndfile.pc.in
    Testing complete. Is sndfile.m4 still needed?

2002-05-09  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * tests/write_read_test.tpl tests/rdwr_test.tpl
    Merged tests from these two programs into write_read_test.tpl and deleted
    rdwr_test.tpl.

2002-05-08  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/w64.c src/svx.c src/paf.c
    Fixed bugs in read/write mode.

2002-05-07  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * examples/Makefile.am
    Renamed sfplay.c to sndfile-play.c and sndfile_info.c to sndfile-info.c for
    consistency when these programs become part of the Debian package
    sndfile-programs.

    * sndfile.pc.in
    New file to replace sndfile-config.in. Libsndfile now uses the pkg-config
    model for providing installation parameters to dependant programs.

    * src/sndfile.c
    Cleanup of code in sf_open().

2002-05-06  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * tests/utils.tpl tests/write_read_test.tpl
    More conversion to Autogen fixes and enchancements.

    * src/*.c
    Read/write mode is now working for 16, 24 and 32 bit PCM as well as 32
    bit float and 64 bit double data. More tests still required.

    * src/Makefile.am
    Added DISTCLEANFILES target to remove config.status and config.last.

    * Win32/Makefile.am MacOS/Makefile.am
    Added DISTCLEANFILES target to remove Makefile.

2002-05-05  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/*.[ch] tests/rdwr_test.c
    More verifying workings of read/write mode. Fixing bugs found.

    * tests/utils.[ch]
    Made these files Autogen generated files.

    * tests/util.tpl tests/util.def
    New Autogen files to generate utils.[ch]. Moved some generic test functions
    into this file. Autogen is such a great tool!

2002-05-03  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/pcm.c src/float_cast.h Win32/config.h
    Fixed a couple of Win32 specific bugs pointed out by Michael Fink
    (maintainer of WinLAME) and David Viens.

    * tests/check_log_buffer.[ch] tests/utils.[ch]
    Moved check_log_buffer() to utils.[ch] and deleted old file.

2002-05-02  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/common.[ch] src/sndfile.c
    New function psf_default_seek() which will be the default seek function
    for things like PCM and floating point data. This default is set for
    both read and write in sf_open() but can be over-ridden by any codec
    during it's initialisation.

2002-05-01  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/au.c
    AU files use a data size value of -1 to mean unknown. Fixed au_open_read()
    to allow opening files like this.

    * tests/rdwr_test .c
    Added more tests.

    * src/sndfile.c
    Fixed bugs in read/write mode found due to improvements in the test
    program.

2002-04-30  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * tests/rdwr_test .c
    New file for testing read/write mode.

2002-04-29  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * m4/*
    Removed all m4 macros from this directory as they get concatenated to form
    the file aclocal.m4 anyway.

    * sndfile.m4
    Moved this from the m4 directory to the root directory asn this is part of
    the distribution and is installed during "make install".

2002-04-29  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/float32.c
    Removed logging of peaks for all file formats other than AIFF and WAV.

    * tests/write_read_test.tpl tests/write_read_test.def
    New files which autogen uses to generate write_read_test.c. Doing it this
    way makes write_read_test.c far easier to maintain. Other test programs
    will be converted to autogen in the near future.

    * src/*.c
    Fixed a few bugs found when testing on Sparc (bug endian) Solaris.

2002-04-28  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * doc/*.html
    Fixed documention versioning.

    * configure.in
    Fixed a bug in the routines which search for Large File Support on systems
    which have large file support by defualt.

2002-04-27  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/*.[ch]
    Found and fixed an issue which can cause a bug in other software (I was
    porting Conrad Parker's Sweep program from version 0 of the library to
    version 1). When opening a file for write, the libsndfile code would
    set the sfinfo.samples field to a maximum value.

    * tests/write_read_test.c
    Added tests to detect the above problem.

2002-04-25  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/*.[ch]
    Finished base implementation of read/write mode. Much more testing still
    needed.

    * m4/largefile.m4
    Macro for detecting Large File Standard capabilities. This macro was ripped
    out of the aclocal.m4 file of GNU tar-1.13.

    * configure.in
    Added detection of large file support. Files larger than 2 Gigabytes should
    now be supported on 64 bit platforms and many 32 bit platforms including
    Linux (2.4 kernel, glibc-2.2), *BSD, MacOS, Win32.

    * libsndfile_convert_version.py
    A Python script which attempts to autoconvert code written to use version 0
    to version 1.

2002-04-24  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/*.[ch]
    Finished base implementation of read/write mode. Much more testing still
    needed.

    * tests/write_read_test.c
    Preliminary tests for read/write mode added. More needed.

2002-04-20  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/sndfile.[ch]
    Removed sf_open_read() and sf_open_write() functions,replacting them with
    sf_open() which takes an extra mode parameter (SF_OPEN_READ, SF_OPEN_WRITE,
    or SF_OPEN_RDWR). This new function sf_open can now be modified to allow
    opening a file formodification (RDWR).

2002-04-19  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/*.c
    Completed merging of separate xxx_open_read() and xxx_open_write()
    functions. All tests pass.

2002-04-18  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/au.c
    Massive refactoring required to merge au_open_read() with au_open_write()
    to create au_open().

2002-04-17  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/*.c
    Started changes required to allow a sound file to be opened in read/write
    mode, with separate file pointers for read and write. This involves merging
    of encoder/decoder functions like pcm_read_init() and pcm_write_init()
    int a new function pcm_init() as well as doing something similar for all
    the file type specific functions ie aiff_open_read() and aiff_open_write()
    were merged to make the function aiff_open().

2002-04-15  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/file_io.c
    New file containing psf_fopen(), psf_fread(), psf_fwrite(), psf_fseek() and
    psf_ftell() functions. These function will replace use of fopen/fread/fwrite
    etc and allow access to files larger than 2 gigabytes on a number of 32 bit
    OSes (Linux on x86, 32 bit Solaris user space apps, Win32 and MacOS).

    * src/*.c
    Replaced all instances of fopen with psf_open, fread with psd_read, fwrite
    with psf_write and so on.

2002-03-11  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/dwvw.c
    Finally fixed all known problems with 12, 16 and 24 bit DWVW encoding.

    * tests/floating_point_test.c
    Added tests for 12, 16 and 24 bit DWVW encoding.

2002-03-03  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * m4/endian.m4
    Defines a new m4 macro AC_C_FIND_ENDIAN, for determining the endian-ness of
    the target CPU. It first checks for the definition of BYTE_ORDER in
    <endian.h>, then in <sys/types.h> and <sys/param.h>. If none of these work
    and the C compiler is not a cross compiler it compiles and runs a program
    to test for endian-ness. If the compiler is a cross compiler it makes a
    guess based on $target_cpu.

    * configure.in
    Modified to use AC_C_FIND_ENDIAN.

    * src/sfendian.h
    Simplified.

2002-02-23  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * tests/floating_point_test.c
    Tests completely rewritten using the dft_cmp function. Now able to
    calculate a quick guesstimate of the Signal to Noise Ratio of the encoder.

2002-02-15  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * tests/dft_cmp.[ch]
    New files containing functions for comparing pre and post lossily
    compressed data using a quickly hacked DFT.

    * tests/utils.[ch]
    New files containing functions for saving pre and post encoded data in a
    file readable by the GNU Octave package.

2002-02-13  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * m4/lrint.m4 m4/lrintf.m4
    Fixed m4 macros to define HAVE_LRINT and HAVE_LRINTF even when the test
    is cached.

2002-02-12  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * tests/floating_point_test.c
    Fixed improper use of strncat ().

    * tests/headerless_test.c
    New test program to test the ability to open and read a known file type as a
    RAW header-less file.

2002-02-07  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * tests/losy_comp_test.c
    Added a test to ensure that the data read from a file is not all zeros.

    * examples/sfconvert.c
    Added "-gsm610" encoding types.

2002-01-29  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/aiff.c
    Improved reporting of encoding types.

    * src/voc.c
    Clean up.

2002-01-27  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/dwvw.c
    New file implementing lossless Delta Word Variable Width (DWVW) encoding.
    Reading 12 bit DWVW is now working.

    * src/aiff.c common.h sndfile.c
    Added hooks for DWVW encoded AIFF and RAW files.

2002-01-15  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/w64.c
    Robustify header parsing.

    * src/wav_w64.h
    Header file wav.h was renamed to wav_w64.h to signify sharing of
    definitions across the two file types.

    * src/wav.c src/w64.c src/wav_w64.c
    Refactoring.
    Modified and moved functions with a high degree of similarity between
    wav.c and w64.c to wav_w64.c.

2002-01-14  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/w64.c
    Completed work on getting read and write working.

    * examples/sfplay.c
    Added code to scale floating point data so it plays at a reasonable volume.

    * tests/Makefile.am tests/write_read_test.c
    Added tests for W64 files.

2002-01-13  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/*.c
    Modded all code in file header writing routines to use
    psf_new_binheader_writef().
    Removed psf_binheader_writef() from src/common.c.
    Globally replaced psf_new_binheader_writef with psf_binheader_writef.

2002-01-12  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/*.c
    Modded all code in file parsing routines to use psf_new_binheader_readf().
    Removed psf_binheader_readf() from src/common.c.
    Globally replaced psf_new_binheader_readf with psf_binheader_readf.

    * src/common.[ch]
    Added new function psf_new_binheader_writef () which will soon replace
    psf_binheader_writef (). The new function has basically the same function
    as the original but has a more flexible and capable interface. It also
    allows the writing of 64 bit integer values for files contains 64 bit file
    offsets.

2002-01-11  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/formats.c src/sndfile.c src/sndfile.h
    Added code allowing full enumeration of supported file formats via the
    sf_command () interface.
    This feature will allow applications to avoid needing recompilation when
    support for new file formats are added to libsndfile.

    * tests/command_test.c
    Added test code for the above feature.

    * examples/list_formats.c
    New file. An example of the use of the supported file enumeration
    interface. This program lists all the major formats and for each major
    format the supported subformats.

2002-01-10  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/*.[ch] tests/*.c
    Changed command parameter of sf_command () function from a test string to
    an int. The valid values for the command parameter begin with SFC_ and are
    listed in src/sndfile.h.

2001-12-20  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/formats.c src/sndfile.c
    Added an way of enumerating a set of common file formats using the
    sf_command () interface. This interface was suggested by Dominic Mazzoni,
    one of the main authors of Audacity (http://audacity.sourceforge.net/).

2001-12-26  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/sndfile.c
    Added checking of filename parameter in sf_open_read (). Previousy, if a
    NULL pointer was passed the library would segfault.

2001-12-18  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/common.c src/common.h
    Changed the len parameter of the endswap_*_array () functions from type
    int to type long.

    * src/pcm.c
    Fixed a problem which

2001-12-15  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/sndfile.c
    Added conditional #include <sys/types.h> for EMX/gcc on OS/2. Thanks to
    Paul Hartman for pointing this out.

    * tests/lossy_comp_test.c tests/floating_point_test.c
    Added definitions for M_PI for when it isn't defined in <math.h>.

2001-11-30  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/ircam.c
    Re-implemented the header reader. Old version was making incorrect
    assumptions about the endian-ness of the file from the magic number at the
    start of the file. The new code looks at the integer which holds the
    number of channels and determines the endian-ness from that.

2001-11-30  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/aiff.c
    Added support for other AIFC types ('raw ', 'in32', '23ni').
    Further work on IMA ADPCM encoding.

2001-11-29  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/ima_adpcm.c
    Renamed from wav_ima_adpcm.c. This file will soon handle IMA ADPCM
    encodings for both WAV and AIFF files.

    * src/aiff.c
    Started adding IMA ADPCM support.

2001-11-28  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/double.c
    New file for handling double precision floating point (SF_FORMAT_DOUBLE)
    data.

    * src/wav.c src/aiff.c src/au.c src/raw.c
    Added support for SF_FORMAT_DOUBLE data.

    * src/common.[ch]
    Addition of endswap_long_array () for endian swapping 64 bit integers. This
    function will work correctly on processors with 32 bit and 64 bit longs.
    Optimised endswap_short_array () and endswap_int_array ().

    * tests/pcm_test.c
    Added and extra check. After the first file of each type is written to disk
    a checksum is performed of the first 64 bytes and checked against a pre-
    calculated value. This will work whatever the endian-ness of the host
    machine.

2001-11-27  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/aiff.c
    Added handling of u-law, A-law encoded AIFF files. Thanks to Tom Erbe for
    supplying example files.

    * tests/lossy_comp_test.c
    Added tests for above.

    * src/common.h src/*.c
    Removed function typedefs from common.h and function pointer casting in all
    the other files. This allows the compiler to perform proper type checking.
    Hopefully this will prevernt problems like the sf_seek bug for OpenBSD,
    BeOS etc.

    * src/common.[ch]
    Added new function psf_new_binheader_readf () which will eventually replace
    psf_binheader_readf (). The new function has basically the same function as
    the original but has a more flexible and capable interface. It also allows
    the reading of 64 bit integer values for files contains 64 bit file
    offsets.

2001-11-26  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/voc.c
    Completed implementation of VOC file handling. Can now handle 8 and 16 bit
    PCM, u-law and A-law files with one or two channels.

    * src/write_read_test.c tests/lossy_comp_test.c
    Added tests for VOC files.

2001-11-22  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/float_cast.h
    Added inline asm version of lrint/lrintf for MacOS. Solution provided by
    Stephane Letz.

    * src/voc.c
    More work on this braindamaged format. The VOC files produced by SoX also
    have a number of inconsistencies.

2001-11-19  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/paf.c
    Added support for 8 bit PCM PAF files.

    * tests/write_read_test.c
    Added tests for 8 bit PAF files.

2001-11-18  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * tests/pcm_test.c
    New test program to test for correct scaling of integer values between
    different sized integer containers (ie short -> int).
    The new specs for libsndfile state that when the source and destination
    containers are of a different size, the most significant bit of the source
    value becomes the most significant bit of the destination container.

    * src/pcm.c src/paf.c
    Modified to pass the above test program.

    * tests/write_read_test.c tests/lossy_comp_test.c
    Modified to work with the new scaling rules.

2001-11-17  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/raw.c tests/write_read_test.c tests/write_read_test.c
    Added ability to do raw reads/writes of float, u-law and A-law files.

    * src/*.[ch] examples/*.[ch] tests/*.[ch]
    Removed dependance on pcmbitwidth field of SF_INFO struct and moved to new
    SF_FORMAT_* types and use of SF_ENDIAN_BIG/LITTLE/CPU.

2001-11-12  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/*.[ch]
    Started implmentation of major changes documented in doc/version1.html.

    Removed all usage of off_t which is not part of the ISO C standard. All
    places which were using it are now using type long which is the type of
    the offset parameter for the fseek function.
    This should fix problems on BeOS, MacOS and *BSD like systems which were
    failing "make check" because sizeof (long) != sizeof (off_t).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the boundary between version 1 of the library above and version 0 below.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2001-11-11  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * examples/sfplay_beos.cpp
    Added BeOS version of sfplay.c. This needs to be compiled using a C++
    compiler so is therefore not built by default. Thanks to Marcus Overhagen
    for providing this.

2001-11-10  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * examples/sfplay.c
    New example file showing how libsndfile can be used to read and play a
    sound file.
    At the moment on Linux is supported. Others will follow in the near future.

2001-11-09  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/pcm.c
    Fixed problem with normalisation code where a value of 1.0 could map to
    a value greater than MAX_SHORT or MAX_INT. Thanks to Roger Dannenberg for
    pointing this out.

2001-11-08  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/pcm.c
    Fixed scaling issue when reading/writing 8 bit files using
    sf_read/sf_write_short ().
    On read, values are scaled so that the most significant bit in the char
    ends up in the most significant bit of the short. On write, values are
    scaled so that most significant bit in the short ends up as the most
    significant bit in the char.

2001-11-07  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/au.c src/sndfile.c
    Added support for 32 bit float data in big and little endian AU files.

    * tests/write_read_test.c
    Added tests for 32 bit float data in AU files.

2001-11-06  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * tests/lossy_comp_test.c
    Finalised testing of stereo files where possible.

2001-11-05  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/wav_ms_adpcm.c
    Fixed bug in writing stereo MS ADPCM WAV files. Thanks to Xu Xin for
    pointing out this problem.

2001-10-24  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/wav_ms_adpcm.c
    Modified function srate2blocksize () to handle 44k1Hz stereo files.

2001-10-21  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/w64.c
    Added support for Sonic Foundry 64 bit WAV format. As Linux (my main
    development platform) does not yet support 64 bit file offsets by default,
    current handling of this file format treats everything as 32 bit and fails
    openning the file, if it finds anything that goes beyond 32 bit values.

    * src/sndfile.[hc] src/common.h src/Makefile.am
    Added hooks for W64 support.

2001-10-21  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * configure.in
    Added more warnings options to CFLAGS when the gcc compiler is detected.

    * src/*.[ch] tests/*.c examples/*.c
    Started fixing the warning messages due to the new CFLASG.

    * src/voc.c
    More work on VOC file read/writing.

    * src/paf.c
    Found that PAF files were not checking the normalisation flag when reading
    or writing floats and doubles. Fixed it.

    * tests/floating_point_test.c
    Added specific test for the above problem.

    * src/float_cast.h src/pcm.c
    Added a section for Win32 to define lrint () and lrintf () in the header
    and implement it in the pcm.c

2001-10-20  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * sndfile-config.in m4/sndfile.m4
    These files were donated by Conrad Parker who also provided instructions
    on how to install them using autoconf/automake.

    * src/float_cast.h
    Fiddled around with this file some more. On Linux and other gcc supported
    OSes use the C99 functions lrintf() and lrint() for casting from floating
    point to int without incurring the huge perfromance penalty (particularly
    on the i386 family) caused by the regular C cast from float to int.
    These new C99 functions replace the FLOAT_TO_* and DOUBLE_TO_* macros which
    I had been playing with.

    * configure.in m4/lrint.m4 m4/lrintf.m4
    Add detection of these functions.

2001-10-17  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/voc.c
    Completed code for reading VOC files containing a single audio data
    segment.
    Started implementing code to handle files with multiple VOC_SOUND_DATA
    segments but couldn't be bothered finishing it. Multiple segment files can
    have different sample rates for different sections and other nasties like
    silence and repeat segments.

2001-10-16  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/common.h src/*.c
    Removed SF_PRIVATE struct field fdata and replaced it with extra_data.

    * src/voc.c
    Further development of the read part of this woefult file format.

2001-10-04  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/float_cast.h
    Implemented gcc and i386 floating point to int cast macros. Standard cast
    will be used when not on gcc for i385.

    * src/pcm.c
    Modified all uses of FLOAT/DOUBLE_TO_INT and FLOAT/DOUBLE_TO_SHORT casts to
    comply with macros in float_cast.h.

2001-10-04  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/voc.c
    Changed the TYPE_xxx enum names to VOC_TYPE_xxx to prevent name clashes
    on MacOS with CodeWarrior 6.0.

    * MacOS/MacOS-readme.txt
    Updated the compile instructions. Probably still need work as I don't have
    access to a Mac.

2001-10-01  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/wav.c src/aiff.c common.c
    Changed all references to snprintf to LSF_SNPRINTF and all vsnprintf to
    LSF_VSNPRINTF. LSF_VSNPRINTF and LSF_VSNPRINTF are defined in common.h.

    * src/common.h
    Added checking of HAVE_SNPRINTF and HAVE_VSNPRINTF and defining
    LSF_VSNPRINTF and LSF_VSNPRINTF to appropriate values.

    * src/missing.c
    New file containing a minimal implementation of snprintf and vsnprintf
    functions named missing_snprintf and missing_vsnprintf respectively. These
    are only compliled into the binary if snprintf and/or vsnprintf are not
    available.

2001-09-29  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/ircam.c
    New file to handle Berkeley/IRCAM/CARL files.

    * src/sndfile.c src/common.h
    Modified for IRCAM handling.

    * tests/*.c
    Added tests for IRCAM files.

2001-09-27  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/wav.c
    Apparently microsoft windows (tm) doesn't like ulaw and Alaw WAV files with
    20 byte format chunks (contrary to ms's own documentation). Fixed the WAV
    header writing code to generate smaller ms compliant ulaw and Alaw WAV
    files.

2001-09-17  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * tests/stdio_test.sh tests/stdio_test.c
    Shell script was rewritten as a C program due to incompatibilities of the
    sh shell on Linux and Solaris.

2001-09-16  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * tests/stdio_test.sh tests/stdout_test.c tests/stdin_test.c
    New test programs to verify the correct operation of reading from stdin and
    writing to stdout.

    * src/sndfile.c wav.c au.c nist.c paf.c
    Fixed a bugs uncovered by the new test programs above.

2001-09-15  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/sndfile.c wav.c
    Fixed a bug preventing reading a file from stdin. Found by T. Narita.

2001-09-12  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/common.h
    Fixed a problem on OpenBSD 2.9 which was causing sf_seek() to fail on IMA
    WAV files. Root cause was the declaration of the func_seek typedef not
    matching the functions it was actually being used to point to. In OpenBSD
    sizeof (off_t) != sizeof (int). Thanks to Heikki Korpela for allowing me
    to log into his OpenBSD machine to debug this problem.

2001-09-03  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/sndfile.c
    Implemented sf_command ("norm float").

    * src/*.c
    Implemented handling of sf_command ("set-norm-float"). Float normalization
    can now be turned on and off.

    * tests/double_test.c
    Renamed to floating_point_test.c. Modified to include tests for all scaled
    reads and writes of floats and doubles.

    * src/au_g72x.c
    Fixed bug in normalization code found with improved floating_point_test
    program.

    * src/wav.c
    Added code for parsing 'INFO' and 'LIST' chunks. Will be used for extract
    text annotations from WAV files.

    * src/aiff.c
    Added code for parsing '(c) ' and 'ANNO' chunks. Will be used for extract
    text annotations from WAV files.

2001-09-02  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * examples/sf_info.c example/Makefile.am
    Renamed to sndfile_info.c. The program sndfile_info will now be installed
    when the library is installed.

    * src/float_cast.h
    New file defining floating point to short and int casts. These casts will
    eventually replace all flot and double casts to short and int. See comments
    at the top of the file for the reasoning.

    * src/*.c
    Changed all default float and double casts to short or int with macros
    defined in floatcast.h. At the moment these casts do nothing. They will be
    replaced with faster float to int cast operations in the near future.

2001-08-31  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * tests/command_test.c
    New file for testing sf_command () functionality.

    * src/sndfile.c
    Revisiting of error return values of some functions.
    Started implementing sf_command () a new function will allow on-the-fly
    modification of library behaviour, or instance, sample value scaling.

    * src/common.h
    Added hook for format specific sf_command () calls to SNDFILE struct.

    * doc/api.html
    Updated and errors corrected.

    * doc/command.html
    New documentation file explaining new sf_command () function.

2001-08-11  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/sndfile.c
    Fixed error return values from sf_read*() and sf_write*(). There were
    numerous instances of -1 being returned through size_t. These now all set
    error int the SF_PRIVATE struct and return 0. Thanks to David Viens for
    spotting this.

2001-08-01  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/common.c
    Fixed use of va_arg() calls that were causing warning messages with the
    latest version of gcc (thanks Maurizio Umberto Puxeddu).

2001-07-25  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/*.c src/sfendian.h
    Moved definition of MAKE_MARKER macro to sfendian.h

2001-07-23  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/sndfile.c
    Modified sf_get_lib_version () so that version string will be visible using
    the Unix strings command.

    * examples/Makefile.am examples/sfinfo.c
    Renamed sfinfo program and source code to sf_info. This prevents a name
    clash with the program included with libaudiofile.

2001-07-22  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * tests/read_seek_test.c tests/lossy_comp_test.c
    Added tests for sf_read_float () and sf_readf_float ().

    * src/voc.c
    New files for handling Creative Voice files (not complete).

    * src/samplitude.c
    New files for handling Samplitude files (not complete).

2001-07-21  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/aiff.c src/au.c src/paf.c src/svx.c src/wav.c
    Converted these files to using psf_binheader_readf() function. Will soon be
    ready to attempt to make reading writing from pipes work reliably.

    * src/*.[ch]
    Added code for sf_read_float () and sf_readf_float () methods of accessing
    file data.

2001-07-20  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/paf.c src/wav_gsm610.c
    Removed two printf()s which had escaped notice for some time (thanks
    Sigbjørn Skjæret).

2001-07-19  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/wav_gsm610.c
    Fixed a bug which prevented GSM 6.10 encoded WAV files generated by
    libsndfile from being played in Windoze (thanks klay).

2001-07-18  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/common.[ch]
    Implemented psf_binheader_readf() which will do for file header reading what
    psf_binheader_writef() did for writing headers. Will eventually allow
    libsndfile to read and write from pipes, including named pipes.

2001-07-16  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * MacOS/config.h Win32/config.h
    Attempted to bring these two files uptodate with src/config.h. As I don't
    have access to either of these systems support for them may be completely
    broken.

2001-06-18  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/float32.c
    Fixed bug for big endian processors that can't read 32 bit IEEE floats. Now
    tested on Intel x86 and UltraSparc processors.

2001-06-13  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/aiff.c
    Modified to allow REX files (from Propellorhead's Recycle and Reason
    programs) to be read.
    REX files are basically an AIFF file with slightly unusual sequence of
    chunks (AIFF files are supposed to allow any sequence) and some extra
    application specific information.
    Not yet able to write a REX file as the details of the application specific
    data is unknown.

2001-06-12  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/wav.c
    Fixed endian bug when reading PEAK chunk on big endian machines.

    * src/common.c
    Fixed endian bug when reading PEAK chunk on big endian machines with
    --enable-force-broken-float configure option.
    Fix psf_binheader_writef for (FORCE_BROKEN_FLOAT ||______)

2001-06-07  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * configure.in src/config.h.in
    Removed old CAN_READ_WRITE_x86_IEEE configure variable now that float
    capabilities are detected at run time.
    Added FORCE_BROKEN_FLOAT to allow testing of broken float code on machines
    where the processor can in fact handle floats correctly.

    * src/float32.c
    Rejigged code reading and writing of floats on broken processors.

    * m4/
    Removed this directory and all its files as they are no longer needed.

2001-06-05  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * tests/peak_chunk_test.c
    New test to validate reading and writing of peak chunk.

    * examples/sfconvert
    Added -float32 option.

    * src/*.c
    Changed all error return values to negative values (ie the negative of what
    they were).

    * src/sndfile.c tests/error_test.c
    Modified to take account of the previous change.

2001-06-04  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/float32.c
    File renamed from wav_float.c and renamed function to something more
    general.
    Added runtime detection of floating point capabilities.
    Added recording of peaks during write for generation of PEAK chunk.

    * src/wav.c src/aiff.c
    Added handing for PEAK chunk for floating point files. PEAK is read when the
    file headers are read and generated when the file is closed. Logic is in
    place for adding PEAK chunk to end of file when writing to a pipe (reading
    and writing from/to pipe to be implemented soon).

    * src/sndfile.c
    Modified sf_signal_max () to use PEAK values if present.

2001-06-03  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/*.c
    Added pcm_read_init () and pcm_write_init () to src/pcm.c and removed all
    other calls to functions in this file from the filetype specific files.

    * src/*.c
    Added alaw_read_init (), alaw_write_int (), ulaw_read_init () and
    ulaw_write_init () and removed all other calls to functions in alaw.c and
    ulaw.c from the filetype specific files.

    * tests/write_read_test.c
    Added tests to validate sf_seek () on all file types.

    * src/raw.c
    Implemented raw_seek () function to fix a bug where
    sf_seek (file, 0, SEEK_SET) on a RAW file failed.

    * src/paf.c
    Fixed a bug in paf24_seek () found due to added seeks tests in
    tests/write_read_test.c

2001-06-01  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * tests/read_seek_test.c
    Fixed a couple of broken binary files.

    * src/aiff.c src/wav.c
    Added handling of PEAK chunks on file read.

2001-05-31  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * check_libsndfile.py
    New file for the regression testing of libsndfile.
    check_libsndfile.py is a Python script which reads in a file containing
    filenames of audio files. Each file is checked by running the examples/sfinfo
    program on them and checking for error or warning messages in the libsndfile
    log buffer.

    * check_libsndfile.list
    This is an example list of audio files for use with check_libsndfile.py

    * tests/lossy_comp_test.c
    Changed the defined value of M_PI for math header files which don't have it.
    This fixed validation test failures on MetroWerks compilers. Thanks to Lord
    Praetor Satanus of Acheron for bringing this to my attention.

2001-05-30  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/common.[ch]

    encoded AIFF files.

1999-11-16  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/common.c
    Fixed put_int() and put_short() macros used by _psf_hprintf() which were
    causing seg. faults on Sparc Solaris.

1999-11-15  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/common.c
    Added string.h to includes. Thanks to Sigbjxrn Skjfret.

    * src/svx.c

    pointing this out.

1999-09-24  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/paf.c
    Fixed a bug with reading and writing 24 bit stereo PAF files. This problem
    came to light when implementing tests for the new functions which operate
    in terms of frames rather than items.

1999-09-23  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/sndfile.c
    Modified file type detection to use first 12 bytes of file rather than
    file name extension. Required this because NIST files use the same
    filename extension as Microsoft WAV files.

    * src/sndfile.c src/sndfile.h
    Added short, int and double read/write functions which work in frames
    rather than items. This was originally suggested by Maurizio Umberto
    Puxeddu.

1999-09-22  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/svx.c
    Finished off implementation of write using __psf_hprintf().

1999-09-21  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/common.h
    Added a buffer to SF_PRIVATE for writing the header. This is required
    to make generating headers for IFF/SVX files easier as well as making
    it easier to do re-write the headers which will be required when
    sf_rewrite_header() is implemented.

    * src/common.c
    Implemented __psf_hprintf() function. This is an internal function
    which is documented briefly just above the code.

1999-09-05  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/sndfile.c
    Fixed a bug in sf_write_raw() where it was returning incorrect values
    (thanks to Richard Dobson for finding this one). Must put in a test
    routine for sf_read_raw and sf_write_raw.

    * src/aiff.c
    Fixed default FORMsize in __aiff_open_write ().

    * src/sndfile.c
    Added copy of filename to internal data structure. IFF/SVX files
    contain a NAME header chunk. Both sf_open_read() and sf_open_write()
    copy the file name (less the leading path information) to the
    filename field.

    * src/svx.c
    Started implementing writing of files.

1999-08-04  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

1999-07-25  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/wav.c src/aiff.c
    Added call to ferror () in main header parsing loop of __XXX_open_read
    functions. This should fix problems on platforms (MacOS, AmigaOS) where
    fseek()ing or fread()ing beyond the end of the file puts the FILE*
    stream in an error state until clearerr() is called.

    * tests/write_read_test.c
    Added tests for RAW header-less PCM files.

    * src/common.h
    Moved definition of struct tribyte to pcm.c which is the only place
    which needs it.

    * src/pcm.c
    Modified all code which assumed sizeof (struct tribyte) == 3. This code
    did not work on MacOS. Thanks to Ben "Jacobs" for pointing this out.

    * src/au.c
    Removed <sys/stat.h> from list of #includes (not being used).

    * src/sndfile.c
    Added MacOS specific #ifdef to replace <sys/stat.h>.

    * src/sndfile.h
    Added MacOS specific #ifdef to replace <sys/stat.h>.

    * src/sndfile.h
    Added MacOS specific typedef for off_t.

    * MacOS-readme.txt
    New file with instructions for building libsndfile under MacOS. Thanks
    to Ben "Jacobs" for supplying these instructions.

1999-07-24  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * configure.in
    Removed sndfile.h from generated file list as there were no longer
    any autoconf substitutions being made.

    * src/raw.c
    New file for handling raw header-less PCM files. In order to open these
    for read, the user must specify format, pcmbitwidth and channels in the
    SF_INFO struct when calling sf_open_read ().

    * src/sndfile.c
    Added support for raw header-less PCM files.

1999-07-22  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    Ben "Jacobs" for pointing this out.

    *src/wav.c
    Fixed as above in __wav_open_read ().

1999-07-01    Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * Win32/*
    Added a contribution from Albert Faber to allow libsndfile to compile
    under Win32 systems. libsndfile will now be used as part of LAME the
    the MPEG 1 Layer 3 encoder (http://internet.roadrunner.com/~mt/mp3/).

    * configure.in
    Changed to reflect previous changes.

    * src/wav_ima_adpcm.c
    Fixed incorrect calculation of bytespersec header field (IMA ADPCM only).

    Fixed bug when writing from int or double data to IMA ADPCM file. Will need
    to write test code for this.

    Fixed bug in __ima_write () whereby the length of the current block was
    calculated incorrectly. Thanks to Jongcheon Park for pointing this out.

1999-03-27  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/*.c
    Changed all read/write/lseek function calls to fread/fwrite/
    fseek/ftell and added error checking of return values from
    fread and fwrite in critical areas of the code.

    * src/au.c
    Fixed incorrect datasize element in AU header on write.

    * tests/error_test.c
    Add new test to check all error values have an associated error
    string. This will avoid embarrassing real world core dumps.

1999-03-23  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/wav.c src/aiff.c
    Added handling for unknown chunk markers in the file.

1999-03-22  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/sndfile.c
    Filled in missing error strings in SndfileErrors array. Missing entries
    can cause core dumps when calling sf_error-str (). Thanks to Sam
    <mrsam at-sign geocities.com> for finding this problem.

1999-03-21  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/wav_ima_adpcm.c
    Work on wav_ms_adpcm.c uncovered a bug in __ima_read () when reading
    stereo files. Caused by not adjusting offset into buffer of decoded
    samples for 2 channels. A similar bug existed in __ima_write ().
    Need a test for stereo ADPCM files.

    * src/wav_ms_adpcm.c
    Decoder working correctly.

1999-03-18  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * configure.in Makefile.am
    Added --enable-justsrc configuration variable sent by Sam
    <mrsam at-sign geocities.com>.

    * src/wav_ima_adpcm.c
    Fixed bug when reading beyond end of data section due to not
    checking pima->blockcount.
    This uncovered __ima_seek () bug due to pima->blockcount being set
    before calling __ima_init_block ().

1999-03-17  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/wav.c
    Started implementing MS ADPCM decoder.
    If file is WAVE_FORMAT_ADPCM and length of data chunk is odd, this
    encoder seems to add an extra byte. Why not just give an even data
    length?

1999-03-16  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/wav.c
    Split code out of wav.c to create wav_float.c and wav_ima_adpcm.c.
    This will make it easier to add and debug other kinds of WAV files
    in future.

1999-03-14  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * tests/
    Added adpcm_test.c which implements test functions for
    IMA ADPCM reading/writing/seeking etc.

    * src/wav.c
    Fixed many bugs in IMA ADPCM encoder and decoder.

1999-03-11  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/wav.c
    Finished implementing IMA ADPCM encoder and decoder (what a bitch!).

1999-03-03  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/wav.c
    Started implementing IMA ADPCM decoder.

1999-03-02  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/sndfile.c
    Fixed bug where the sf_read_XXX functions were returning a
    incorrect read count when reading past end of file.
    Fixed bug in sf_seek () when seeking backwards from end of file.

    * tests/read_seek_test.c
    Added multiple read test to short_test(), int_test () and
    double_test ().
    Added extra chunk to all test WAV files to test that reading
    stops at end of 'data' chunk.

1999-02-21  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * tests/write_read_test.c
    Added tests for little DEC endian AU files.

    * src/au.c
    Add handling for DEC format little endian AU files.

1999-02-20  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/aiff.c src/au.c src/wav.c
    Add __psf_sprintf calls during header parsing.

    * src/sndfile.c src/common.c
    Implement sf_header_info (sndfile.c) function and __psf_sprintf (common.c).

    * tests/write_read_test.c
    Added tests for 8 bit PCM files (WAV, AIFF and AU).

    * src/au.c src/aiff.c
    Add handling of 8 bit PCM data format.

    * src/aiff.c
    On write, set blocksize in SSND chunk to zero like everybody else.

1999-02-16  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/pcm.c:
    Fixed bug in let2s_array (cptr was not being initialised).

    * src/sndfile.c:
    Fixed bug in sf_read_raw and sf_write_raw. sf_seek should
    now work when using these functions.

1999-02-15  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * tests/write_read_test.c:
    Force test_buffer array to be double aligned. Sparc Solaris
    requires this.

1999-02-14  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/pcm.c:
    Fixed a bug which was causing errors in the reading
    and writing of 24 bit PCM files.

    * doc/api.html
    Finished of preliminary documentaion.

1999-02-13  Erik de Castro Lopo  <erikd AT zipworld DOT com DOT au>

    * src/aiff.c:
    Changed reading of 'COMM' chunk to avoid reading an int
    which overlaps an int (4 byte) boundary.
